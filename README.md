# Description
These questions are some of the most common ones asked in interviews. A portion are questions that come from companies like Google, Facebook, Uber, Amazon etc.

# v1
v1 folder contains solutions for each problem the best I could solve for at the time.

# v2 (Use this one)
v2 folder contains solutions for each problem redone. Between the first time I went through this challenge and the second time, I had improved my knowledge of space and time complexity. I learned how to better identify problem solving patterns and used this opportunity to improve TypeScript syntax.
